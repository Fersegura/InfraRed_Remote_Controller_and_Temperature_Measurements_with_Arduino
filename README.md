# Branch with MQTT protocol
---

The front end of the project will remain the same while the transmit protocol will be MQTT. The back end will consist of an online broker, a new webpage (the php files have to change and we do not want to delete the previous ones), a python script that will be runing locally in a virtual machine and a fully renwed microcontroller code.
